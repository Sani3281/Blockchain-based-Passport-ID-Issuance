# Blockchain-based Passport/ID Issuance

## Project Description
This project provides a decentralized system for issuing and verifying digital Passports or ID cards using blockchain technology. It ensures secure and immutable identity verification with full transparency and tamper-resistance, backed by smart contracts.

## Project Vision
To build a reliable, secure, and globally accessible blockchain-based platform for managing government-issued identity credentials—reducing forgery, improving verification speed, and ensuring privacy.

## Key Features
- 🔐 **Government-Only Issuance**: Only the designated government authority can issue passports.
- 🧾 **Immutable Records**: Once issued, a passport record is permanently stored on the blockchain.
- 🌐 **Public Verification**: Anyone can verify the authenticity of a passport using an address.

## Future Scope
- 🧬 Integration with biometric systems for identity validation.
- 🌍 Cross-border passport validation through international smart contract standards.
- 📲 Frontend app for citizens to view and manage their digital IDs.
- 🔏 Enhanced privacy using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).
- 🧩 Role-based access and multi-authority verification layers.
